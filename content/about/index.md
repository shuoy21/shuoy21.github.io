Hello! My name is Shuo Yan. I am a student in University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign with a double major of psychology and statistics. 

My interest lies in clinical psychology. My career goal is to be a psychiatrist or a conselor. I also have strong passions in math and statistics.

I am currently a research assistent in BEAST Lab which focuses on how emotion affects reasoning.

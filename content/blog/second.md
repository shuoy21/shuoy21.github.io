I wrote this handwriting recognizer which recognizes handwriting dragged on the laptop touch bar. 

To use it, simply drag a letter on your touch bar and the program tells you what you've just written.

It's based on naive bayes algorithm. If you are interested, please check out [handwriting recognizer](https://github.com/uiuc-sp18-cs126/final-project-shuoy21)

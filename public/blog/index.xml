      <description>I wrote this handwriting recognizer which recognizes handwriting dragged on the laptop touch bar.
To use it, simply drag a letter on your touch bar and the program tells you what you&amp;rsquo;ve just written.
It&amp;rsquo;s based on naive bayes algorithm. If you are interested, please check out handwriting recognizer</description>
